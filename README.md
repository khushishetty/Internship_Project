Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine learning models

The main objective of the Credit card fraud prediction is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

The steps involved in the project are:

1. exploring the dataset also visualizing as well as cleaning the data set .

2. Data preprocessing (removing the NAN or NULL values).

3. building machine learning models

4. evaluating the models

5. final model creation (classification report, confusion matrix and accuracy score and analysis outcome.

Final result of analysis : The accuracy obtained is 0.998 .
